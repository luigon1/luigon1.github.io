    I chose software development because 
		
i have a huge passion for technology! I 

believe if i learn this skill i can use it to 

change others lifes! I also want to change 

my life and vastly improve my familys life! 

The oppertunity to become a software 

engineer would be a great  

accomplishment  for myself. Im ready to 

get out and meet new people and explore 

the world!
